<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Hi, I'm Jason! Born in Utah, rasied in both Utah and Washington I was rasied to appreciate the outdoors <br />
but I also gained a love for computers and video games at a young age. Now, at 27 I've decided to explore <br />
education and employment in tech, or more specifically, in web development. よろしく！
